## Introduction
**BuildSystem** is a simple but powerful - as the name already says - system for builders, with lots of great features for everyday usage.
Manage worlds in the worlds navigator, change their permission, projects and status with ease.
And not to forget: let each player decide which settings whey think are best for them and now the building can start!
